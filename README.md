# P6 - Create a real estate rental web application with React

In this educational project, I assumed the role of a front-end developer tasked with revamping a 10-year-old website, Kasa. Utilizing React with Sass and React Router, my responsibility was to create the new website based on a provided mockup.

To successfully carry out this project, I first initiated the project and created various pages along with routes using React Router. I designed different reusable components including a Carousel, dropdown, navbar, and card. I made use of various React functionalities such as props, useState, useRef, and map. Additionally, ensuring the website was responsive was also a crucial aspect of the project.
